## Oriyan's Student Position Project

Welcome to NSOProject! This project was a great learning experience for me as I delved into Android Studio and explored new programming techniques.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this exercise is to examine my ability and knowledge
in the following domains:
 Android development environment (Android Studio)
 Android basic JAVA development
 Android Native (c / c++) development via JNI
 Native dynamic library loading concepts
 Native (c / c++) build system handling and integration of third
party modules
 ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) understanding, parsing and
manipulation via the LIEF (https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF)
project
 Simple code injection
method (http://phrack.org/issues/61/8.html) using "NEEDED"
library dependency technique
 Basic Frida dynamic instrumentation (https://frida.re/)
